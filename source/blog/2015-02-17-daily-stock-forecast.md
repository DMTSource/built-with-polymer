Daily Stock Forecast is an experimental service for day trading professionals built with Polymer and Material Design. Using historical stock prices and machine learning, DSF forecasts the next day's open, close, high, and low stock prices from the AMEX, NYSE, and Nasdaq exchanges (more exchanges coming soon). It offers full exposure of the model's past 10 day performance for each stock via performance correlation with actual prices(mouse over the bar plot items for scatter plots).

Daily Stock Forecast is powered by Polymer, Google App Engine, Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Datastore, Python 2.7, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Yahoo!Managed, and more great open source tech. Daily stock lists and historical data are obtained from the Nasdaq Company List and Yahoo Finance.

DSF is open source and [can be found on github](https://github.com/DMTSource/daily-stock-forecast)
